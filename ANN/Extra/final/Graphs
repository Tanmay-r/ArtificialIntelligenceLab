Alongwith the implementation of the all assignments (boolean functions, digit recognition, FFNN)

Following analysis and experiments are also expected:

1. Effect of learning rate [Epoch no. vs Learning Rate for all func]  /////

2. Symmetry Breaking: What happens if all weights are initialized with same values? Why? [Epoch no. vs Weight(same for all) for all func]///////

3. Observations regarding Saturation [Saturation for all neuron in a given Epoch no. for all func]

4. Observations regarding Momentum Factor [Epoch no vs Momentum for all] /////////////

5. Observations regarding convergence time [Same as above just requires interpretaion which is summary of above]

6. Observations regarding local minima //////////////////

7. Effect of initialization of weights

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. total Sum Square Error : Plot the graph of error (y-axix) vs. iteration no. (x-axis) //////////////

2. Show these curves for varying values of learning rate and momentum factor for all problems.

3. Observe the effect of increasing the momentum too from close to 0 (0.001) to close to 1 (0.9).rons in

4. When the error does not decrease suspect local minimum. But also check if any neuron is saturated (o/p close to 1 or 0).

5. If by any measure the error does not decrease, increase the number of neurons in the hidden layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. VIMP: deduce what the hidden neurons are doing. In XOR do they compute X1X2' and X1'X2 followed by an OR? Similarly what do the hidden neurons do in case of palindrome? That is the most interesting part of the assignment.
